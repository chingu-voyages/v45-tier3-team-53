| An Animal Adoption Agency | site for rescued animals. We will have animal table, species table, adopter table, adoption application table etc. We will get to practice on those relationships in sql db. Many views could generate from it. Those views can help the agency's daily tasks. If we have time we can incorporate a map to see which area has more pets to adopt. If free db and hosting are possible, we can ultimately give this app to some nonprofit organizations.  | | | | | | |
| pet animal office managing app | an app to help the vet office to manage appointments, customers, their pets etc. We could have role in the auth, the app can have admin view, employee view, customer view. If time permits, a google calendar like clone can input each appointment will be great. | | | | | | |
